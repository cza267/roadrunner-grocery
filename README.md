#### Search:
- From here, you can browse whatever products you may like. By default, all products are shown so if you would like to narrow the results down then type in your desired product into the search bar at the top.
- In this activity, you may also select which products you would like, set your desired number of items, and add them to your cart.
- You may check the cart at any time by pressing the cart icon in the top-right both the Main and Search activities.

#### Cart:
- This activity will display a top-down list of all of the items that you have added to your cart. You may scroll through the items and check the quantity and price as you move along.
- Decided that you would rather not have an item that you've added to the cart? Go ahead and press the slash cart icon next to the image of the product that you would like to remove.
- After everything has been reviewed, press checkout to move on to the payment section.

#### Checkout/Receipt:
- The checkout process is fairly simple, just move along the text boxes from top to bottom, and fill them out according to their hints (name, phone number, etc).
- After you have finished providing your information, you will be provided with a receipt of your order. This receipt shows the products ordered, their prices, and the personal info attached to the order.

> We do not actually take any of your personal information, this is said for the purpose of our school project. The info provided will not leave your phone, and will stay within the application.
